# Weather Prediction based on Deep Learning using Tensorflow and Python
This project was created as part of the EES210: Basic Electrical Engineering Laboratory class in Electrical Engineering at SIIT. The aim of this project is to develop deep learning models for weather forecasting using Tensorflow and Python. The deep learning models involved in this project include CNN1D, MLP, and Siamese.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called train_data.nc, which contains weather information from Phathum Thatni between 2018 to April 2023. To use this dataset, you will need to download the train_data.nc file and use dataset.py to generate the dataset for use in any of the deep learning model files.

# Installation and Usage
To use this project, you will need to have Python and Tensorflow installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions below to install and run the project:

# Download the Training_Data.nc file from the project repository.
Run DataSet.py to generate the dataset from Training_Data.nc for use in the deep learning model files.
Choose one of the deep learning model files (NN_CNN1D.py, NN_MLP.py, NN_siamese.py, or NN_siamese_with_diff_relu) and run it to train the model and make predictions.
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make weather forecasts based on the input data.
